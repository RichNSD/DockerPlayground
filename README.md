# Welcome to my <br /> :whale: Playground

The goal behind this repository (and the primary reason I created it) is to add some clarity to what I've found to be an unusually hazy subject: __Docker Files__

To be clear, that space between __*Docker*__ and __*Files*__ was intentional, because it's more than just build files that I've had a hard time with. Put simply, if it has to do with Docker (and I've touched it) I've either done it wrong, or flat-out broken it. ðŸ™ƒ

### So that includes:
- __Project/Build Files__
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `.dockerignore`
  - `compose.yml`
    - `docker-compose.yaml` <br />*depricated but still backwards-compatible*
- __Docker Config Files__
  - `daemon.json`
  - `Something else I'm forgetting.json`

## Current Resources

Don't get me wrong, I *have* been able to learn a lot from the information available- specifically [Docker's Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com). That being said...
