# Welcome to my <br /> :whale: Playground

The goal behind this repository (and the primary reason I created it) is to add some clarity to what I've found to be an unusually hazy subject:


## Docker Files

That space between *Docker* and *Files* was intentional, because it's more than just the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` files that I've had a hard time with, but basically any file related to Docker.

So that includes:
- `daemon.json`
